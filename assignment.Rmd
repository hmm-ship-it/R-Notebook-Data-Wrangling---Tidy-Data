```{r}
library(tidyverse)

table1
table2
table3
table4a
table4b

table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)

table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))

```


1.  In table 1 variables are the columns and observations are organized by country and year.In table two it can be further subdivided by cases and population. table 3 has countries with observations by year and rate. Table four makes year a variable. has country and years as variables, with population listed beneath. The mutated tables split everything up nicely.
